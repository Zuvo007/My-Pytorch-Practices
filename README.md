# My-Pytorch-Practices
I was doing a great 6 weeks session from Jovian ml
That was a community where everone has the domain
related to ML and AI
so the experiences of those 6 weeks were great
sharing some of my work what I learn from them 
And this course is published on youtube on freecodecamp channel
That is a great experience
